<p>For this project, I have decided to make a Portfolio for myself as I thought it would help when I need to really make one
in the future. This project will give my audience, who are possible employers, a introduction to who I am and what I do.</p>

<h>Design Process</h>
<p>For this particular portfolio of mine, I wanted to make it a simple and easy to navigate website so that every information of mine can be found easily through the navigation bar. The color scheme I chose was based on my personal favourite color "Beige". Through some research, I found 2 fonts that I felt were quite pleasing to the eye which were "Rubiks, Sans-Serif" and
"Gloria Hallelujah, Cursive". <br>

So as a employer, what I want to see when I enter this website is first of all, a background check on the candidate, then more on his experience and what he is able to achieve. </p>

<h>Features</h>
<p>In my website, I have 4 navigation pages. An "About" page for my background check, "Connections" page for my different work social networks, "Boys' Brigade" page to show my commitment in the past and "Experience" page to show my past work experiences.
In my "Connections" page, a feature I added was hyperlinking images to quickly bring them to my social network based on the image they clicked. </p>

<h>Technologies Used</h>
</p> I used HTML and CSS to do this project. My IDE used was Visual Studio Code. </p>
