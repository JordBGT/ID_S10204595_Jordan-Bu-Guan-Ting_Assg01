<p>For this project, I have decided to make a Portfolio for myself as I thought it would help when I need to really make one
in the future. This project will give my audience, who are possible employers, a introduction to who I am.</p>

<h>Design Process</h>
<p>For this particular portfolio of mine, I wanted to make it a simple and easy to navigate website so that every information of mine can be found easily through the navigation bar. The color scheme I chose was based on my personal favourite color "Beige". Through some research, I found 2 fonts that I felt were quite pleasing to the eye which were "Rubiks, Sans-Serif" and
"Gloria Hallelujah, Cursive". I decided that at the start of the page, I welcome my audience and give them options on which they want to see first. Upon clicking the button, it will bring them to the selected page. For my About page, I decided that I will put in my Name, Skills and Hobbies so that they will know more about me. In my Boys' Brigade page, I have decided to make a scrollable gallery and describe each picutre. Pictures will give a better demonstration on what i will be desciribng in my journey in BB. In my Connections page, I have decided to link my different network accounts such as LinkedIn, Github and Bitbucket as these are IT related.<br>

So as a employer, what I want to receive from this website is more on his personal profile and commitments in the past.

<h>Features</h>
<p>In my website, I have 3 navigation pages. An "About" page for my personal profile, "Connections" page for my different work social networks and contact form and "Boys' Brigade" page to show my commitment in the past.
In my "Connections" page, a feature I added was hyperlinking images to quickly bring them to my social network based on the image they clicked.

<h>Technologies Used</h>
