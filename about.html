        <h2>A quote that inspires me</h5>
        <p2>
            One quote that inspires me a lot is <br>
            " Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, but today is a gift. That is why it is called present" - Master Oogway <br>
            This quote inspires me a lot because it emphasizes on trying to live the present day to your fullest. Once the present passes, <br>
            it will become history, however, the following day, you will receive the present again. <br> 
            Each day, the "tomorrow" will always be a mystery, we will never know what tomorrow becomes, <br>
            therefore, living each day to your fullest will make us feel like our lives are very fruitful. :) <br>
