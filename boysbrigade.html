        <div class="desc">This was a very memorable moment of my journey in BB as this was the very moment where I was a 
            Company Sergeant Major (CSM), which was the highest ranking in the hierachy in a Senior Company. However, it 
            was not only because of the rank that mattered, but also the fact that whatever decisions I make does not only 
            affect myself, but the entire company also. Therefore from that day onward, heavy responsibilites dwell onto me.

        <div class="desc">About a year has gone by and here I am, receiving the award for being the "Best Boy" in my company. 
            The "Best Boy Award" is awarded to only one boy per company each year, therefore making it a valuable award. Receiving this 
            meant a lot to me as it showed that the company had trust in me and felt that I was a good leader.

        <div class="desc">Ahh... The Founders Award. This is the highest award that a Senior Boy can ever achieve. 
            Upon receiving this award, not only does your company look up to you, by wearing the Founders Badge, boys from all 
            companies will stare in awe at you. This award is not easy to achieve as it requires heavy commitment. For us, it took 
            about roughly a year to manage to fully fulfil the criterias, and that does not stop there. Out of all 100 plus companies, 
            only about 150 candidates manage to secure this award.

        <div class="desc">Now, enough of my accolades. Let's move on to some hands on activity that I did during my BB years. 
            This was one of them. BB Blaze, or known as BB Adventure Quest, is sort of a triathlon but without swimming. It is a race 
            between all BB companies and it is held every year. The route is roughly 40 plus kilometers, and it is mostly running and cycling. 
            Boys are required to have strong physique to enter the race, but fitness is not the only playing factor here. Boys are also 
            required to know topography, as the route will not be given, and we have to plan our route ourselves based on the coordinates given.
            Depending on how fast you are, the race can last from 8 hours to 12 hours. In between the coordinates, there are stations which
            rewards points and the goal is to get as many points as possible. To win the race, you have to get the most points and be as fast
            as possible. As seen on the image, we were wearing ponchos, as there was suddent CAT1 and we had to seek shelter, thus the race 
            was terminated. It was disappointing, but we were glad that everyone was safe and did not fall sick.

        <div class="desc">Every year, there will be an event called "BB Share-A-Gift". You may have heard of it or seen BB Boys in Fairprice
            seeking for donations, be it monetary or food. These food will be collected and sent to the BB Headquarter. Once it reaches the
            headquarter, there will be other boys who will pack the food into this hanker bags and then delivered to each companies. Companies
            will then deliver these bags to those needy. This is called "Community Service" in BB. Different companies have different roles,
            but they all have the same goal, which is to help the people in need. Our role that year was to deliver the hanker bags to the needy.
            We were separted into teams, and we ventured into different blocks. What I learnt from this community service was that we should
            not take things for granted. What we have right now, may not be accessible to some, and we should always be grateful for what 
            we have.
