Repository for Interactive Development Assignment 1 (S10204595)

<p>For this project, I have decided to make a Portfolio for myself as I thought it would help when I need to really make one
in the future. This project will give my audience, who are possible employers, a introduction to who I am.</p>

<h>Design Process</h>
<p>For this particular portfolio of mine, I wanted to make it a simple and easy to navigate website so that every information of mine can be found easily through the navigation bar. The color scheme I chose was based on my personal favourite color "Beige". Through some research, I found 2 fonts that I felt were quite pleasing to the eye which were "Rubiks, Sans-Serif" and
"Gloria Hallelujah, Cursive". <br>

So as a employer, what I want to receive from this website is more on his personal profile and commitments in the past.

<h>Features</h>
<p>In my website, I have 3 navigation pages. An "About" page for my personal profile, "Connections" page for my different work social networks and contact form and "Boys' Brigade" page to show my commitment in the past.
In my "Connections" page, a feature I added was hyperlinking images to quickly bring them to my social network based on the image they clicked. 
</p>

<h>Technologies Used</h>
</p> I used HTML and CSS to do this project. My IDE used was Visual Studio Code. </p>
